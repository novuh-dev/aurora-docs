# Aurora Documentation

*This repository is supposed to help guide you whether you're new to botting, or an experienced botter.*

Aurora's goal is to be friendly enough to allow new botters to come to the scene and hit the ground running, while allowing experienced botters to get the best experience possible from our competition alike.

### KEY NOTES
- [Cookies](#Cookies)
- [Proxies](#Proxies)
- [Captchas](#Captchas)

## Cookies
### What are cookies?
Cookies are a way for ROBLOX to automatically log you in when you go to their website. They can be exploited in a way to allow mass-use of their API, which is what botting is all about.
### How do I get cookies?
You can use the *Cookie Generator* on Aurora to generate them, make new accounts yourself (*see: "My Cookies are not Working"*), or you can buy them from a 3rd party.
### My cookies are not working / Why am I not getting any results?
Cookies (especially generated ones) can be banned, or invalidated. This can happen for a multitude of reasons, for instance, avoid logging into your cookies as logging out will reset them and make the invalid. You may not be getting results because of this, however, we try to be as transparent as possible on client to avoid confusion.
### Where do I put my cookies?
Inside `cookies.txt` which may appear as just `cookies` for you if you have file extensions turned off. *See ["File Extensions"](#File-Extensions)*
## Proxies
### Proxy standards for Aurora
Proxies **MUST** be in the `ip:port` format. Any other format results in a crash. HTTP proxies **ONLY**.
### What are proxies?
Proxies are a way to mask your true IP address to bypass ratelimiting.
### How do I get proxies?
Aurora *officially* support [Webshare.io](https://www.webshare.io/?referral_code=a73vxuxqdsnb) proxies. Just ensure you're using [IP authorization](https://help.webshare.io/article/21-configure-ip-authorization).
### Where do I put my proxies?
After verifying their [format](#Proxy-standards-for-Aurora), you can put them in `proxies.txt` which may appear as just `proxies` for you if you have file extensions turned off. *See ["File Extensions"](#File-Extensions)*
## Captchas
*Aurora supports both [2Captcha](http://2captcha.com/?from=9370211) & [Anticaptcha](http://getcaptchasolution.com/rghlcnkarn).*
### What are captchas used for?
* Cookie Generator
* Group Joiner
* Login2Cookie
### How do I get a "captcha key"?
You can go to [2Captcha](http://2captcha.com/?from=9370211) or [Anticaptcha](http://getcaptchasolution.com/rghlcnkarn) to get one.
